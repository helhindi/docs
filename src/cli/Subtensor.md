# Running locally - Subtensor
--- 
Subtensor is our network blockchain and keeps a record of every transaction that occurs. A new block is created and recorded every 12 seconds - or "blockstep" - at which time a new round of Tao is distributed. 


By connecting to Nakamoto, you automatically gain access to Subtensor. Running a Subtensor instance locally, however, will ensure a faster and more consistent experience in the case that the network is compromised or slowed by high traffic. It is therefore **highly** recommended to run Subtensor locally for serious miners.



## Running Subtensor 


1. Prepare your system by updating outdated packages in your system, and installing the newest available ones. You can do this in two commands. 


```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```


2. Install an application package software to maintain Subtensor locally. Bittensor mining is very computationally complex, and software like this will help allocate appropriate resources. We recommend using Docker. For more information, follow this [link](https://www.docker.com/).


Run the following commands:


```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```

```bash
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```


3. Install Subtensor


```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor.git ~/.bittensor/subtensor
```


4. Connect with the Subtensor directory 


```bash
cd ~/.bittensor/subtensor
```


5. Pull the latest Subtensor image 


```bash
docker pull opentensorfdn/subtensor
```


6. Run Subtensor inside of your application package software 


```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```


7. Check that Subtensor is fully synced


```bash
docker logs --since=1h node-subtensor 2>&1  | grep "best"
```


Here is an example of a synced copy of Subtensor:


```bash

node-subtensor    | 2022-04-27 01:32:22 Accepted a new tcp connection from 172.22.0.1:50608.    
node-subtensor    | 2022-04-27 01:32:22 Accepted a new tcp connection from 172.22.0.1:50612.    
node-subtensor    | 2022-04-27 01:32:22 Accepted a new tcp connection from 172.22.0.1:50616. 
```


In case your Subtensor goes down, here is the command to restart it: 


```bash
# quick restart
cd ~/.bittensor/subtensor && \
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose down && \
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d

# full restart
cd ~/.bittensor/subtensor && \
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose down && \
docker system prune -a -f && \
git -C ~/.bittensor/subtensor pull origin master && \
docker pull opentensorfdn/subtensor && \
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d
```


Lastly, here are the steps to ensure both Bittensor and Subtensor are up to date. 


Update Bittensor: 


```bash
git -C ~/.bittensor/bittensor pull origin master
python3 -m pip install -e ~/.bittensor/bittensor
```


Update Subtensor: 


```bash
#Connect to directory
cd ~/.bittensor/subtensor
#Bring Subtensor down
sudo docker-compose down
#update Subtensor
sudo git pull
#Bring Subtensor back up 
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
